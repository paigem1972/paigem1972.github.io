                <h5>For this project my partner, Jun Jie Li, and I had to make a movie website by using the skills we’ve learned so far.</h5>
                <p>This is the first project that was assigned to the 10th grade this year. We had to work with the person who sat next to us, and my partner and I decided to make a movie about our favorite genres: Horror and Fantasy.</p>
                <p> The movie’s premise is that the small fictional town, Westbrow, has had seven disappearances in the past month due to reasons unknown. The protagonist, Tiffany Smith, was completely unbothered by the disappearances that were plaguing her town. Tiffany simply had more important things to do, such as practicing for cheer or planing out how she going to ask Emma Lynn to the movies with her. Well, this is what Tiffany thought until Sarah McCarthy, the school’s most popular girl, canceled the Halloween party she was throwing due to the recent tragedies. This was supposed to be the biggest party of the year, and Tiffany can’t stand to see it not happen. In order to make Sara reconsider canceling, Tiffany has to put an end to what’s causing these disappearances. She soon figures out that what she’s dealing with is much more despicable than a guy with a machete, but instead a creature that is pairs of pitch-black arms covered in eyes. </p>
